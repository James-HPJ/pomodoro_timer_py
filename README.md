# Pomodoro Timer App

## Description

The Pomodoro Timer App is a Python application built using Tkinter that helps you implement the Pomodoro Technique for time management. It allows you to break your work into intervals of focused work (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (typically 5 minutes). This cycle repeats, and after a certain number of work intervals, a longer break (typically 15-30 minutes) is taken.

## Features

- Set custom work and break durations
- Start, pause, and reset functionality
- Visual for interval changes
- Simple and intuitive user interface

```
git clone https://github.com/James-HPJ/pomodoro_timer_py.git

```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run the application:

## Usage

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
2. The timer will run through the work intervals and breaks according to the specified durations.
